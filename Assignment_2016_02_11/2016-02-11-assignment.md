## 2E1  Pr(rainjMonday)

## 2E2 The probability that it is Monday, given that it is raining.

## 2E3 Pr(rainjMonday) Pr(Monday)

## 2E4 It means that 70% of the time that the globe was tossed and caught, one observed water. It also makes the assumption that if the probability of water is produced at 0.7, then the probability of land should be 1-(probability of water) = 0.3. 
#In the globe tossing experiment, every observation is independent of one another and does not influence the next observation. In light of Finettiâ€™s quote and this experiment, our knowledge of the globe at the beginning of the experiment 
#was that there are two states to observe: Water or Land. While we have made assumptions of the probability of how often water or land occurs, it still does not give us an accurate depiction of what the true water:land ratios are. 

## 2M3 I need help with this one. 

## 2M4 
#ways <- c( 0 , 2 , 3 , 0  )
#ways/sum(ways)
